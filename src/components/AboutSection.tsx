              I operate at the intersection of a bold vision and ground-floor reality. From the CEO's office at a high-growth AI startup, my role is to translate ambition into executionâ€”launching 0-to-1 products, architecting go-to-market strategies, and scaling the operational engines that drive growth. I thrive in the chaos of unorganized sectors, building the frameworks that create momentum. I own the outcome and bridge the gap between founder vision and market reality. Ultimately, I believe the best products are built so compellingly that your customers don't just buy them; they invest in them.
