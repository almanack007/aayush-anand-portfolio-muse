            My focus is the full 0â†’1 journey: taking a product from its first version to a scalable business. At a high-growth startup, that means I launch the product, build the go-to-market strategy, and help lead the fundraising that fuels our growth. I aim to build a product so effective that its first customers become its first investors.

            This hands-on approach started long before my current role. At the Birla Institute of Technology, my engineering work ran parallel to actively co-leading the e-cell and the IEEE student branch. But the real lesson came from RoboGears, a stealth venture I co-founded to sell affordable robotics parts. Building a supply chain from scratch and selling over 50 units taught me more than any textbook could.

            Every role has been a step towards one goal: to be an entrepreneur who builds impactful companies. I am not just building a career; I am building the foundation for my own venture.
